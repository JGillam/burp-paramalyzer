## Development Notes
This project was built using IntelliJ IDEA and uses a Gradle build (as per Portswiggers requirements for BAppStore integration).

Assuming you are bringing this into IntelliJ to work on it, you should be able to build using the Gradle `burp-paramalyzer[fatJar]` target.

However, if you make significant changes through the UI designer, it may be necessary to run a build from the project menu (`Ctrl-F9`) to regenerate the UI component code. It may also be necessary to run this twice (you will know when you see errors about things it can't seem to find). Once the UI designer code is regenerated, you can go back to using the Gradle fatJar target.
